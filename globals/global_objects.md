<!-- type=misc -->

These objects are available in all modules. The following variables may appear
to be global but are not. They exist only in the scope of modules, see the
[module system documentation][]:

- [`__dirname`][]
- [`__filename`][]
- [`exports`][]
- [`module`][]
- [`require()`][]

The objects listed here are specific to Node.js. There are a number of
[built-in objects][] that are part of the JavaScript language itself, which are
also globally accessible.
